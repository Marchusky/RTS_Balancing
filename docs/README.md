I am [Victor Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-chen-556670182), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).


# Introduction

In this project, I will be covering the basic concepts of balancing an RTS game and taking a deep dive in the complexity that they inherently carry. Furthermore, I will explain some of the methods used in order to reach our desired objective.

#### Game Balance

First of all, in game design, the concept of balance is closely related to adjusting the rules and fine-tuning the stats for different game elements in order to avoid the abuse of one really strong mechanic/unit. Contrarily, you also don't want an ineffective or useless element that no one desires to use because of the fact that said element is overshadowed by everything else.

In RTS, balancing is a core aspect of the design of these specific genre. This is because a slight overtune on a stat on a specific troop can make the game revolve around creating and swarming with said troop. Thus making the game stale and one-dimensional rather than one relying on wits and outmanouvering your opponent with a superior strategy.
